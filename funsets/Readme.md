## funsets

This exercise dealt with functional sets, which are defined by a function from a number type (here it is integers) to a boolean.

We first had to create basic functions, such as a singleton set containing a single element, union, intersections and difference of sets as well as a filter function for all elements of a set satisfying a given condition.

Then we had to define a 'for all' and a 'exists' function that would return a true boolean only if all elements of the set satisfy a given condition and if there is at least one element satisfying the condition respectively, and a map function which returns a set of the function of all elements in a given set.
